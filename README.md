# Pokemon-Type-Leaderboard

This app allows access to a leaderboard of the Pok√©mon types.
Each type / type combination has a score which is calculated through the offensive and defensive potential.

Currently, the types / type combinations are only checked against single types.
To access the leaderboard, simply run ```node index.js``` in your terminal.
You can change the code to change the order or view a different set of elements on the leaderboard, of course.
